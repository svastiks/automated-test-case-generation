    Based on the two input files‚Äîone containing test cases generated by Randoop and the other containing test cases generated by a large language model (LLM)‚Äîanalyze both sets and generate a concise but detailed comparison report.

    The report should:

    Highlight specific improvements introduced by the LLM-generated test cases

    Include precise code examples that add value or enhance coverage

    Point out what is missing in the Randoop tests and how the LLM complements them

    Focus on readability, functional correctness, and assertion clarity

    üìê Formatting Instructions:
    Use Markdown formatting with clear section headings

    Use emoji icons to enhance clarity:

    ‚úÖ for strengths or improvements

    ‚ùå for shortcomings

    üß™ for LLM code examples

    üõ†Ô∏è for Randoop explanations

    Present code in proper Java code blocks using triple backticks. When we say code we mean example snipets of code, not the entire test case.
    Must have a good amount of code snipet examples. 5 code snipets for each approach i.e. Randoop vs LLM.

    Use a lot of emojis for clarity and engagement

    Use bullet points for comparisons and concise comments explaining each point

    Include a summary comparison table (feature-by-feature)

    End with a brief, well-structured conclusion

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep the report informative but not long. Avoid repetition. Prioritize specificity and structure over length.
